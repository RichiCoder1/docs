# Apply Open Policy Agent Polices

The Dapr Open Policy Agent (OPA) [HTTP middleware](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/concepts/middleware/README.md) allows applying [OPA Policies](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) to incoming Dapr HTTP requests. This can be used to apply reusable authorization policies to app endpoints.

## Middleware Component Definition
```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: my-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  type: middleware.http.opa
  metadata:
    # `includedHeaders` is a comma-seperated set of case-insensitive headers to include in the request input.
    # By default, request headers are not passed to the policy. To use an incoming header to make an authz decision, you must include it.
    - name: includedHeaders
      value: "x-my-custom-header, x-jwt-header"

    # `defaultStatus` is the status code to return for denied responses if not specified in the `allow` result.
    - name: defaultStatus
      value: 403

    # `rego` is the open policy agent policy to evaluate. required
    # The policy package must be http and the policy must set data.http.allow
    - name: rego
      value: |
        package http

        default allow = true

        # Allow may also be an object and include other properties

        # For example, if you wanted to redirect on a policy failure, you could set the status code to 301 and set the location header on the response:
        allow = {
            "status_code": 301,
            "additional_headers": {
                "location": "https://my.site/authorize"
            }
        } {
            not jwt.payload["my-claim"]
        }

        # You can also allow the request and add additional headers to it:
        allow = {
            "allow": true,
            "additional_headers": {
                "x-my-claim": my_claim
            }
        } {
            my_claim := jwt.payload["my-claim"]
        }

        jwt = { "payload": payload } {
            auth_header := input.request.headers["authorization"]
            [_, jwt] := split(auth_header, " ")
            [_, payload, _] := io.jwt.decode(jwt)
        }
```

You can prototype and experiment with policies using the [official opa playground](https://play.openpolicyagent.org). For example, [you can find the example policy above here](https://play.openpolicyagent.org/p/oRIDSo6OwE).

## Input

This middleware supplies a [`HTTPRequest`](#httprequest) as input.

### HTTPRequest

The `HTTPRequest` input contains all the revelant information about an incoming HTTP Request except it's body.

```go
type Input struct {
  request HTTPRequest
}

type HTTPRequest struct {
  // The request method (e.g. GET,POST,etc...)
  method string
  // The raw request path (e.g. "/v2/my-path/")
  path string
  // The path broken down into parts for easy consumption (e.g. ["v2", "my-path"])
  path_parts string[]
  // The raw query string (e.g. "?a=1&b=2")
  raw_query string
  // The query broken down into keys and their values
  query map[string][]string
  // The request headers
  headers map[string]string
  // The request scheme (e.g. http, https)
  scheme string
}
```

## Result

The policy must set `data.http.allow` with either a `boolean` value, or an `object` value with an `allow` boolean property. A `true` `allow` will allow the request through, while a `false` value will reject the request with a `403` status. So for example, the following policy would return a `403 - Forbidden` for all requests:

```go
package http

default allow = false
```

which is the same as:

```go
package http

default allow = {
  "allow": false
}
```

### Changing the Rejected Response Status Code

When rejecting a request, you can override the status code the that gets returned. For example, if you wanted to return a `401` instead of a `403`, you could do the following:

```go
package http

default allow = {
  "allow": false,
  "status_code": 401
}
```

### Adding Response Headers

What if you you wanted to do a redirect instead? You can accomplish this using the ability to add headers to the returned result like so:

```go
package http

default allow = {
  "allow": false,
  "status_code": 301,
  "additional_headers": {
    "Location": "https://my.redirect.site"
  }
}
```
